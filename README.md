## Dhito

"Dhito" is a traditional practice in Nepali culture, especially in the context of jewellery businesses. It refers to a system where customers purchase items on credit, and the details of the credit transactions are maintained for future reference. Dhito is often used to build trust and long-term relationships with customers.

In the Jewellery Dashboard, the Dhito module allows businesses to keep track of customer credit transactions, outstanding balances, repayment schedules, additional Lilami, and receive notifications for important events.
